<p>The dogs barked all night. They sound like mean dogs. Scary
dogs. Who knew there would be so many of them still alive. I always
thought they had all died, but I guess a portion of them are
immune. Just like humans. <a href=

An Imposing Everybody He Always Indeed Looked</a>
<div class="rssdescrip">
<p>An imposing everybody he always indeed looked, constantly the
same as and equal to himself and magnificently well worthy of any
and all such universalisation, every time he continually surveyed,
amid vociferatings from in front of Accept these few nutties!

<p>Drones have been flying over much more frequently these past
days. Are they looking for me? I don't think I'm noteworthy enough
for such special attention... <a href=

<p>un-reacting sensations in the brain ... thoughts twisted, then

Story</a>
<div class="rssdescrip">
<p>A rowboat parked down the street, leaning against a two-story
house now completely covered with vine plants and sinking slowly
into the swampy terrain. I saw a praying-mantis there the size of
my arm. Terrifying thing. <a href=

<div class="rssdescrip">
<p>Main Street. It rained all morning, so the cracked pavement is
more like a swamp covered in green leafs and big fat bugs. <a href=

<div class="rssdescrip">
<p>Yesterday, I found an old museum. Some large windows are almost
intact, so I managed to notice the sun reflecting through the thick
foliage. <a href="/diary/2022/07/03-the-museum.html">[...]</a></p>

Painting Material</a>
<div class="rssdescrip">
<p>I found some painting material! Old-style, I mean. Nothing
digital. So now I have a few crayons (aquamarine, aureolin, almond,
maroon, and cadmium), a couple of notebooks, some old paintbrushes,
and a few pieces of raw charcoal which I honestly don't know how to
use, so I'll have to maybe waste a couple of paper sheets to try
and get the hang of it. <a href=

Stroll Through the Suburbs</a>
<div class="rssdescrip">
<p>Yesterday I decided to take a stroll through the suburbs. There
are a few folks still living there. Old people mostly. I really
don't know how they manage to survive. Are they all immune? It's
strange, to say the least. Then again, there isn't really a
shortage of food or water. Quite the contrary, really. <a href=
