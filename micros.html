  <blockquote>
    The machine is said to <i>execute</i>
    an instruction when it does a series of actions
    in response to the instruction code.
    But it's not as if the machine is <i>alive</i>
    or anything.
    It's not analyzing the machine code and deciding what to do.
    Each machine code is just triggering various
    control signals in a unique way that causes the machine 
    to do various things.

    Open the window and let the smog in. This is the smell of
    humanity. This is the texture of civilization. Open the
    window and let the greasy grayness inside your lungs and
    into your veins. Soon your brain cells will float in smoke
    and your thoughts will travel in the excrement of the city.
    Soon we will all be smog.

  <blockquote>
    True art always appears where we don’t expect it, where nobody thinks of it or
    utters its name. Art detests being recognized and greeted by its own name. . . .
    As soon as it is divulged or pointed out, it flees and leaves in its place a
    glorified bit-player carrying on its back a large poster marked ART; everyone
    immediately sprinkles it with champagne, and lecturers lead it from town to town
    with a ring through its nose. This is the false Monsieur Art. He is the only one
    known by the public, since he bears the poster and the laurel.

    "While commercial websites display more and more
    agressive messages, target and track their users, the
    indie web respects the individuals, their intelligence
    and their privacy; it’s an open forum for thoughts
    and debate.  While purely commercial websites turn
    into information and entertainment magazines, while
    tycoons of media, telecom, computing and military
    agencies fight for the control of the Internet, the
    indie web offers a free vision of the world, bypasses
    the economic censorship of news, its confusion with
    advertising and infommercial, its reduction to a
    dazing and manipulating entertainment."

    "But rather than allowing a massive reduction of
    working hours to free the world's population to pursue
    their own projects, pleasures, visions, and ideas,
    we have seen the ballooning of not even so much of the
    service sector as of the administrative sector, up to
    and including the creation of whole new industries
    like financial services or telemarketing, or the
    unprecedented expansion of sectors like corporate law,
    academic and health administration, human resources,
    and public relations. And these numbers do not even
    reflect on all those people whose job is to provide
    administrative, technical, or security support for
    these industries, or for that matter the whole host
    of ancillary industries (dog-washers, all-night pizza
    delivery) that only exist because everyone else is
    spending so much of their time working in all the
    other ones."

    "The goal of most national economies is
    to achieve unlimited growth of their GDP through
    the continuing accumulation of material goods and
    expansion of services… Since human needs are finite,
    but human greed is not, economic growth can usually be
    maintained through the artificial creation of needs
    through advertising. The goods that are produced and
    sold in this way are often unneeded, and therefore
    are essentially waste. Moreover, the pollution and
    depletion of natural resources generated by this
    enormous waste of unnecessary goods is exacerbated
    by this waste of energy and materials in inefficient
    production processes"

    convince the body to give them access to more and more
    resources."

    "The promise of established peace and heaven on
    earth is still one of the great propaganda tricks
    with which naive people are lured. They give a
    religious devotion to the communistic idea because
    of the attractive archetypal image, while those who
    maneuver the movement have short-sighted and worldly
    purposes in mind. In practical life this is one of
    the most unfortunate combinations; criminal action
    and destructive activity are often secretly combined
    with an unreal, unrealized religious ideal. What I
    exemplify here in collective movements one sees as
    well in an outbreak of psychosis. Psychotic people
    often have somewhere in the innermost recesses of
    their souls a kind of childish paradise dream which
    estranges them from life; yet from this they draw all
    their passionate impulses. It is really the secret
    behind their completely self-destructive emotional
    behavior. It even enables them to commit terrific
    crimes with a completely clear conscience.
