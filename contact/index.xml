please repeat after me:
om mani padme hum.
again:
om mani padme hum.
now keep saying these six syllables
in your mind,
over and over till nothing else

till your thinking processes
become purified, clear,
perfectly in sync with the universe.

it will become you,

The medic stares at my sore scalp through cracked lenses. There are frail tweezers and alcohol, rusty syringes aligned between two poetry books, intermittently blinking monitors looking like long-abandoned miniature aquariums, vials of expired drugs in half-rotten cardboard boxes, a row of crimson-glazed ants marching past the abandoned decanters like a conquering army&amp;mdash;
