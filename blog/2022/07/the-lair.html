    <h1>
            
            The Lair - a short story                                                                                                      </h1>

    <p>
    Joseph P.
    liked to sit down on the doorsteps of
    St. Anthony's chapel.
    From there he oversaw the entire
    village, with its narrow streets winding down the hill like
    old roots stretching out to the dry riverbed.
    <br></br>
    Most houses were empty.
    Some were inhabited by gray old
    people too afraid of stepping out to the blinding sunlight.
    Not Joseph, though.
    He was not afraid of the sun.
    Mostly because he had an important task in hands:
    behind the small chapel on the top of the hill,
    under a centenary olive-tree,
    he had started to build a lair.

    <br></br>
    Once completed, he sat inside, admiring the tree's rugged
    roots serving as walls, and fell asleep with the comforting
    knowledge that everything was going to turn out fine.

    <br></br>
    Outside, the golden hills rustled under a perfect,
    cloudless blue sky,
    and far away, a flock of sheep bleated under an olive-tree.

    <br></br>
    That same night, Joseph took his possessions to the lair:
    a few clay pots, clothes, candles, food and water.

    <br></br>
    Then he waited.

    <br></br>
    On the third day he woke up from the afternoon nap
    and found it was already dark.
    Oppressively dark.

    <br></br>
    Joseph fumbled inside the hole and lit a candle.
    His wristwatch marked 4.pm.
    Joseph understood that it had
    already happened and couldn't help but feel disappointed
    for having slept through it.

    <br></br>
    But...
    Where were the fires,
    the flaming skies, the screaming hordes, the hounds of
    hell feasting on the flesh of children?
    Was it all silently happening beyond the dim light of his candle?

    <br></br>
    The sky above was so black, it was more like an absence than a darkness.

    <br></br>
    Joseph paced around the chapel, but the village and
    surrounding hills were submerged in darkness, and
    he couldn't make himself go down the stairway to the
    streets below.
    For all he knew, nothing out there existed anymore.
    He thought of going inside the chapel, but for
    some reason that scared him even more than everything else.

    <br></br>
    For a week
    (according to his wristwatch; he couldn't tell otherwise)
    he slept and ate inside the lair under the olive-tree.
    Then he ran out of food, and, despite not
    feeling hungry, finally found the courage to do something.

    <br></br>
    Halfway down the stairs stood the tiny house where old
    Francesca had raised five children.
    Now, barely illuminated by the candlelight,
    it looked like a dry skull hiding in the silent darkness.

    <br></br>
    Joseph stumbled from house to house, cursing himself for
    having thought that candles would provide enough light.

    <br></br>
    <i>But none of this was supposed to happen.
        Not like this...</i>

    <br></br>

<br>
    He found some food, but ate none of it.
    Some houses had plates
    with food still looking perfectly eatable even after a week.

    <br></br>
    In the café near the center square, he found a more convenient
    source of light, powered by gas and capable of illuminating
    both sides of the street at the same time.
    But even then, the darkness and silence were oppressive,
    and he had this terrifying feeling
    that he could fall into the black sky at any moment.

    <br></br>
    Afraid to leave the village, he roamed the streets and
    houses for so long that he grew accustomed to the ruthless solitude.
    In fact, his nervous system became so sensitive
    that Joseph could hear his own heartbeat and,
    if he strained his hearing,
    the blood flowing in his veins would sound as alive as a river.

    <br></br>
    One day, Joseph tried to remember when he had eaten for
    the last time.
    Frustrated, he threw the wristwatch into the darkness and
    decided he wasn't going to eat or drink anymore—even if
    he felt hungry again.

    <br></br>
    Then he counted one step, two steps, three, four...
    By the time he reached a thousand steps, he was already outside the village.
    Locked inside his small sphere of light he
    couldn't tell where he had wondered.

    <br></br>
    At that moment, his world consisted of a piece of asphalt.

    <br></br>
    Many thousand steps later, Joseph found a river.
    He stepped into the motionless warm
    water, then he took off his clothes, dropped
    down the gaslight and threw himself into the dark liquid,
    intent on drowning right there.

    <br></br>
    He found that, as with food and drink, he had no longer
    any need for air.

    <br></br>
    Joseph sunk to the bottom of the river.
    Why was his heart still beating?
    Was he alive?
    Dead?
    Still in the hole, dreaming all this?

    <br></br>
              
            
                                                                                                                        


<div class="smalls">
  <img src=/img/portfolio/theglasspixel--digital-art--Corpolums/04.jpg alt="image detail"/><img src=/img/portfolio/theglasspixel--digital-art--Corpolums/03.jpg alt="image detail"/><img src=/img/portfolio/theglasspixel--digital-art--Corpolums/09.jpg alt="image detail"/><img src=/img/portfolio/theglasspixel--digital-art--Corpolums/07.jpg alt="image detail"/><img src=/img/portfolio/theglasspixel--digital-art--Corpolums/01.jpg alt="image detail"/><img src=/img/portfolio/theglasspixel--digital-art--Corpolums/02.jpg alt="image detail"/><img src=/img/portfolio/theglasspixel--digital-art--Corpolums/06.jpg alt="image detail"/><img src=/img/portfolio/theglasspixel--digital-art--Corpolums/05.jpg alt="image detail"/><img src=/img/portfolio/theglasspixel--digital-art--Corpolums/08.jpg alt="image detail"/><img src=/img/portfolio/theglasspixel--digital-art--Corpolums/10.jpg alt="image detail"/></div>
<br>
    He got out of the water and decided to go back to the chapel.
    He had played many times as a boy in that same river,
    so he knew more or less where he was.

    <br></br>
    A million steps later he found an old dirt road he knew
    led to the village.
    But he noticed the dirt was more like
    a mist, as if floating slightly above the surface.

    <br></br>
    He also felt lighter,
    and his clothes seemed looser.
    He threw a stone above his head
    and watched as it slowly came down
    and landed on his shoulder
    with a soft thud.

    <br></br>
    Joseph had to hurry, otherwise he could
    simply float into space.
    But hurry where?
    To his hole?
    For all he knew, there was no hole.

    <br></br>
    The village was still there...
    And the stairway leading to
    the chapel and the olive tree,
    but the place was submerged in a fog of dirt.
    Everything was disintegrating.

    <br></br>
    Joseph jumped into the hole and found the only thing he needed:
    a shovel.
    </p>
