                  Bill's Art Exhibition                                                                  </h1>

  <p>
  The last time I went to an art exhibition was maybe a year ago
  when my friend Bill was courteously invited by the Metro
  Tower Art Complex's administration
  to showcase a few of his most popular sound-and-vision
  happenings.
  <br></br>
  So, I had to go all the way over
  to the top floors of one of the central towers, down by the
  seashore.
  It took me almost half a day just to get there,
  and then it turned out that the entrance was down on the ground
  level.
  Yes, on level zero,
  deep in forest and swamp territory.
  <br></br>
  Fortunately, the organizers were courteous enough to provide
  everybody with masks, boots and all the rest...
  And by everybody, I mean me, myself, some other guy,
  and two mean-looking women heavily tattooed
  with political logos of the anarchic-biosynthesis persuasion.
  <br></br>
  One of those nice ladies had a vine plant
  growing out of her backside and wrapping around her torso and neck.
  They both smelled of chlorophyll and fermentation.
  Very nasty indeed.
  <br></br>
  Anyway, as I later discovered,
  the trip down to the ground was in itself the first
  'happening': one of Bill's famous
  transavantgarde/environmental/neo-cyber-genetic
  (a mouthful, I know!)
  performance pieces that used to be so snubbed by the
  art intelligentsia
  but then became all the rage.
  Nowadays, as we all know very well,
  that kind of stuff is completely passé,
  even ridiculed.
  <br></br>
  For spacial guidance, we had a single bright-green
  butterfly-like thing
  that flopped around in the air,
  completely disappearing for long periods of time
  during which we just sat around watching the
  fist-sized mosquitos trying to pierce our
  protective garments.
  <br></br>
  Obviously, I can't describe the art pieces proper,
  due to the increasingly ridiculous
  non-disclosure agreements
  that now plague the art world...
  I did try once to get an art-critic license
  from the central office of intellectual property,
  but my request was summarily refused,
  even ridiculed,
  as they now don't accept anyone
  older than sixteen years old
  and with viral-ready limbic-chips
  embedded since the age of two.
  <br></br>
  "Only viral art is proper art!"
  and all that...
  <br></br>
  Anyway, why am I even writing about things I can't write
  about?
  I guess I can say that I very much enjoyed the whole thing,
  and would recommend the experience to anyone who can muster
  the courage to venture down there.
  <br></br>
  Stay tuned for more posts, my friends!
  <br></br>
  Oh, and if any of you know about Bill's whereabouts,
  please contact me, or the authorities, or anyone really.
  I miss getting drunk and high with ol'Bill...
