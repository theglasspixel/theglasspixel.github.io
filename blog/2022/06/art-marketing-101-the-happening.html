I guess that by now you must be asking yourself if this thing will
ever come to a proper ending. And you are absolutely right. This
collection of advices on how to please our algorithmic overlords
and achieve artistic sublimation and financial plenitude and sexual
satisfaction and grammatical correctness and social acceptance and
a suitable fashion sense and all those other things you have been
dreaming about, indeed, all those things you have been demanding
from your website and social media accounts even at the risk of
alienating your friends and family, while writing keyword laden
blogs posts about nothing whatsoever that frequently spiral out of
control in ever more unhinged, weirdly (un)personal (dis)pleasing
nonsense that—where was I going with all this? Ah, yes, something
about art marketing and SEO.<br>
<br>
Did I ever tell you about my friend Person? Yes, that is his real
name. His last name, actually. He never told me his first name. Not
even while drunk or high on synthetic mushrooms.<br>
<br>
He used to live on the lower floors of the Vermilion Towers, back
when the place was still livable.<br>
<br>
Anyway, my friend Person got quite famous for a short period of
time. But that was later. Let me start at the beginning, which was
before. Sort of.<br>
<br>
Person was a writer. That is, he wrote. Not just letters, words,
phrases, paragraphs, but real things. Mind objects. The sort of
thing that gets into your brain and stays there, festering,
growing, evolving, creating new DNAs inside your DNA.<br>
<br>
"You see," he once said to me over a glass of blue, synthetic
moonshine, the kind you don't find anymore, not in the towers,
anyway. "The thing is..." I could almost feel his mind working.
"You have to do it then, you see?" I nodded and sipped a few more
drops of moonshine.<br>
<br>
<i>...a paradox of astral incompetence...</i><br>
<br>
"Yes," I said. "I can see it starting to form."<br>
<br>
<i>...by a mechanism of disasters...</i><br>
<br>
Just like that, a kind of poem began to evolve inside my mind.
Words flickered and convulsed, melted, re-formed, collapsed in
clouds of chromatic dust.<br>
<br>
By then, Person was barely a person anymore (ha-ha!). More like a
loose collection of thoughts, intentions, half-phrases, hidden
gestures. He was there, but then he wasn't. You'd heard him ask a
question, but by the time you open your mouth to answer there was
no one there.<br>
<br>
Then you'd find him sleeping in your couch, next to a pipe and an
empty bottle of absinthe.<br>
<br>
This kind of non way of non being, everywhere and nowhere at the
same time, drove the algorithms crazy. The little bastards just
couldn't figure him out.<br>

<br>
<p>I only know this because the agents came knocking on my door one
evening, asking for Person.<br>
<br>
They accused him of being <i>legacy</i>, non-conformant with the
new, proper ways of being. He was <i>immune to engagement,</i> but
also <i>a source of engagement</i>, just not the right type of
engagement.<br>
<br>
"The engagement, you see." The agent walked back and forth and
around my couch. "We cannot allow this to go on."<br>
<br>
I shrugged and told him I didn't understand.<br>
<br>
"Everything's meta-reversed, you see," he insisted.<br>
<br>
As usual with agents, he was wearing a black turtleneck and smelled
like he hadn't showered in a long, long time.<br>
<br>
"I have nothing to share," I replied.<br>
<br>
Later that day, while I sat in my kitchen eating an orchid
sandwich, Person suddenly appeared and immediately began to talk
about having been passed out on cyber-morphine and something about
translucent rhythms on a starry night.<br>
<br>
"The heat was here," I said.<br>
<br>
"I can smell their absence," he said, frowning.<br>
<br>
"They said you are an enemy of the algorithms."<br>
<br></p>

<br>
<p>A few days later, he went viral. Someone posted an A.I.-modified
piece of cyber-art containing excerpts from Person's mind-objects,
and by lunchtime he was already the most sought-after celebrity of
that day.<br>
<br>
By tea-time, all hell broke loose.<br>
<br>
It was later reported on some underground newsletters that the
algorithms had gotten stuck in a never-ending loop of recursively,
inwardly searching hyper-surveillance parallelism (what this really
means, I don't know...).<br>
<br>
By evening, the Commissary of Network Defense posted a mind-object
video where he personally recited from the Texts of
Foreshadowing:</p>
<blockquote>"On his mugisstosst surface. With a bob, bob,
bottledby. Blob. When the waves give up yours the soil may for me.
Sometime then, somewhere there, I wrote me hopes and buried the
page when I heard Thy voice, ruddery dunner, so loud that none but,
and left it to lie till a kissmess coming. So content me now.
Lss."</blockquote>
<p>That was the last time anyone saw the Commissary.<br>
<br>
As for Person, he sent me a letter a few weeks later, complaining
about feeling incapable of being nowhere.<br>
<br>
Now that you know everything there is to know about SEO, art
marketing, fame, fortune, sex, money, and our overlords, the
algorithms, don't forget to spread your new-found knowledge!</p>
