  <h1>
                                          Evolution - a short story            </h1>

  <p>
  "Keep quiet, please."
  <br></br>
  The medic stares at my sore scalp through cracked
  lenses. There are frail tweezers and alcohol, rusty syringes
  aligned between two poetry books, intermittently blinking
  monitors looking like long-abandoned miniature aquariums,
  vials of expired drugs in half-rotten cardboard boxes,
  a row of crimson-glazed ants marching past the abandoned
  decanters like a conquering army---

  <br></br>
  "I don't think you've been honest with me..."

  <br></br>
  On the veranda, a chrysanthemum flower blooms like a flesh
  wound, its petals stretching across the windows.

  <br></br>
  "You should destroy that thing," I hear myself saying.

  <br></br>
  "What's the point?" The medic sighs. He glances at
  the six-foot flower, annoyed, shuffling his feet on the
  dirt-green floor. A cloud of rotten, moldy smell sticking
  to him like a bad skin disease.

  <br></br>
  "Yep. This isn't a legit chip."

  <br></br>
  He drops the tweezers on a pool of gray liquid, a lake
  of sorts for a pair of dragonflies with dark-turquoise,
  translucent wings fluttering in slow motion as if beating
  invisible drums.

  <br></br>
  "So?" My gray, skinny, dried-up hands clasp the medic's
  dirty coat. "So?" What a disgusting man. "What difference
  does it make to you?"

  <br></br>
  "I don't have the appropriate tools."

  <br></br>
  "I just want you to remove it."

  <br></br>
  "Remove?" He slowly sits down behind his desk. "Something
  like that would kill you, you know? Your mind wouldn't
  handle the---" He trails off. "Say," he suddenly
  jumps to an unusually cheerful voice. "Have you ever
  tried Dr. Max's Cinnamon-Lemon Super-Shiny Toothpaste®?"

  <br></br>
  "What...?"

  <br></br>
  "It's the only toothpaste that guarantees full freshness
  and amazingly healthy teeth." The medic stares at me with
  a deranged grin. "And all that for only 4.99!"

  <br></br>
  Fuck. The chip is acting up again.

  <br></br>
  "You know," The medic charges again. "There are some
  things money just can't buy, but for everything else
  there's The Hyper Credit Card®! Think Different®,
  Buy the World®!"

  <br></br>
  On the gray pool, the dragonflies talk to the ants and
  glare back at me with large dark reflective eyes.

  <br></br>
  "See? This is what I was talking about, doc."

  <br></br>
  No use insisting. This quack is too incompetent to help me.

  <br></br>
  "You should find whoever installed the chip," the medic
  says in a slow, deliberate voice. "I can't work with
  that low-budget, foreign stuff." He stares at me with
  insect eyes. "That is, if they are still alive."

  <br></br>
  "Probably not."

  <br></br>
  Outside, the vegetation is already taking hold, hanging
  from the inter-tower passages in long strains that go
  all the way down five, ten floors. The street is now a
  dark swamp where giant trees compete with the towers for
  territorial domination.

  <br></br>
  {{< smalls >}}

  "I need to go down to the twentieth floor."

  <br></br>
  The elevator driver stares at me like I'm out of my mind.

  <br></br>
  "Why the fuck would you want to do that?"

  <br></br>
  "I have family there."

  <br></br>
  "Oh?" he lowers his voice. "They're all dead down there,
  you know?"

  <br></br>
  "Not all."

  <br></br>
  "You know what I mean." He rushes the words through his
  teeth. "For fuck's sake, just go find some other elevator
  'cuz I'm not going to take you down."

  <br></br>
  "I have some money..."

  <br></br>
  "Hmm?" he grunts at me. "How much?"

  <br></br>
  "Not much..."

  <br></br>
  "Fuck off then!"

  <br></br>
  "Do you know if the stairs are still usable?"

  <br></br>
  "Don't know, don't care," he shrugs, "and you shouldn't
  either."

  <br></br>
  I bolt out of there before he turns into an advertisement.

  <br></br>
  The stairway disappears inside the tower like a giant
  digestive tract overrun by disgustingly luxurious
  vegetation. How the fuck did it get up here already? There
  are cockroaches and spiders everywhere. Plus centipedes
  and millipedes and an intense smell of mold and rotten wood.

  <br></br>
  The towers are being eaten alive. Millions upon millions
  of human beings pushed to the upper floors above the
  clouds. I guess that at some point they will have to start
  jumping out of windows just to keep from getting crushed.

  <br></br>
  A woman comes up the stairs. Tall, blonde, impeccably
  dressed, perfect skin. She approaches me.

  <br></br>
  "Do you have trouble sleeping?" Her silky voice echoes
  through the hall. "Do you suffer from stress? Anxiety? Do
  you have trouble performing sexually?"

  <br></br>
  The hall lightens up to white walls and tall windows
  in sunlight. A fresh scent of fruits and roses fills my
  nostrils. A sharp pain shoots across my brain.

  <br></br>
  "Only 9.99!" the woman's voice fades into oblivion.

  <br></br>
  Under bright ghostly lights I'm pulled back into the
  network, vibrating to the tune of trillions of network
  packets speeding through rotten cables, rusty machines,
  melting glass on overheated boards. So I look for
  information. Where are the ones from the lower floors? All
  searches lead to walls of advertisement, viruses, emerging
  trends, predictive shopping-lists, governmental popularity
  contests, lusty women, and... insects, swarms of locusts,
  aphids, butterflies and fireflies, maggots and moths,
  all wanting to be my friends, followers, customers...
  A six-foot tall praying mantis grabs me from behind.

  <br></br>
  "Do you want to be my limbic-buddy?" It slithers inside
  my head. "We're going to be so viral!"

  <br></br>
  I'm thrown out onto meat-world once again and wake up
  covered in centipedes and moldy leafs, my lungs stinging,
  itching, burning. Nearby, a cat snaps a large spider
  and runs away with hairy legs wiggling out of his mouth,
  following a trail of white, sweetly-scented lilacs down
  the overrun stairs.

  <br></br>
  It smells like a swamp in here, but also like a junkyard.

  <br></br>
  "Do you have any?"

  <br></br>
  The man stands right next to the stair's exit. There's a
  hole in his head with a silvery glass orb cushioned right
  in the middle. I guess he tried to pull his chip out.

  <br></br>
  "Is this the twentieth?"

  <br></br>
  "Do you have any?"

  <br></br>
  "Is---"

  <br></br>
  "You don't have any? Fuck you!"

  <br></br>
  "I don't know what---"

  <br></br>
  "Fuck you!"

  <br></br>
  He limps away towards a small jungle of vine stems hanging
  from an upper balcony.

  <br></br>
  {{< smalls >}}

  "Wait," I yell. "Do you know where's the chip implantation
  store?"

  <br></br>
  "The what now?" He rasps from behind the plants.

  <br></br>
  "I got my chip from a store right here in the twentieth,
  and---"

  <br></br>
  "None of that stuff here."

  <br></br>
  "I know it was on this floor, and---"

  <br></br>
  "Try one of the other towers."

  <br></br>
  "Wait... I think... I think it was you. You put this chip
  in my head! Yeah, I remember. It was you and---"

  <br></br>
  "You remember nothing," he lowers his voice as if pitying me.
  "You're lost."

  <br></br>
  The hall seems to shake and vibrate like flickering
  electric light turned oxygen-deprived moisten air.

  <br></br>
  "It's..." I stutter. "It's malfunctioning. The chip I mean.
  When I try to communicate with them... All I see is
  ads and---"

  <br></br>
  "So? What the fuck do you want? Consider yourself lucky
  for being alive." His entire face seems to hide behind
  a wall of wrinkles and scar tissue. "Now go away please."

  <br></br>
  Nearby, a foot-long spider lazily stretches silk strands
  across the abandoned entrance to a store with a pink
  fluorescent sign that still blinks "Everlasting Pets."

  <br></br>
  "I'll have to kill myself," I say. "I really mean it."

  <br></br>
  "So? What's it to me?" His beady, black eyes stare at
  me insect-like. "Why don't you just sit there on the
  floor and let nature take its course? You don't really
  have to kill yourself, you know? Or you can go all the
  way to the top floors and---they'll put your mind into
  some station, no questions asked, and off you go across
  the universe and all that... Eternal life!"

  <br></br>
  Outside, the rain sizzles against the tall windows,
  leaving strands of greenish matter that slowly corrode
  the thick glass. There's a sudden agitation as leaves
  and stems all around reach for the renewed, moist air.

  <br></br>
  "Can you smell it?" The man says right next to me as if
  suddenly congealed. "It smells like corpses, doesn't it?"
  The stench of his breath is so strong I have to stand back.
  "Soon we will all be corpses." His fingers stroke
  my scalp, like tendrils burrowing inwards. "Look," he
  mutters. "Look." His stretched, dried-up, wrinkled fingers
  open up revealing a large scarab, gleaming red and blue,
  with black legs curled like fangs. "There's your chip."

  <br></br>
  "What...? No, that's not---"

  <br></br>
  The scarab's wings unfold slowly, translucent and
  glimmering.

  <br></br>
  "You are free now." The medic stares from behind his
  cracked lenses. "Consider yourself enlightened."
  He points to the old computer sitting on the desk.
  "You are on your way to outer space."

  <br></br>
  "What...? But I'm right here..."

  <br></br>
  "That's only your body!" The medic raises his voice for
  a split second only. "Your data has been uploaded. You
  are eternal now. On your way to the stars."

  <br></br>
  "So... What do I do now?"

  <br></br>
  "Who cares? Your data is eternal. All else is inconsequential."

  <br></br>
  "But... what about the ads, and---"

  <br></br>
  "You are an ad now!" The medic presses a button and the
  window glass slides upward letting the damp, pollen-rich
  air swirl inside. "As for that pathetic thing you lunge
  around..." He gestures to the open window. "You should
  feed it to the forest."

  <br></br>
  The last thing I see on my way down is an enormous orchid
  sprouting from the tower, blinking in bright pink "Let
  your mind go! 99.99 for today only!!"

  <br></br>
  Yes, nature is finally learning.
