    <p>
    <a href="/blog/2022/05/art-marketing-101-how-i-learned-to-stop-worrying-and-love-the-algorithm.html">Part I</a></br>
    <br></br>

    Last night I had a dream.
    I really shouldn't bother you with it,
    but I guess I'm going to anyway.
    You see--the thing is--how should I start...
    Well, when I woke up today,
    first thing I saw was this cute little spider
    perching right on top of my nose.
    And the dammed thing winked at me!

    <br></br>
    Actually, it was not that little.
    Or cute.
    More like a black grape with hairy legs,
    and long eyelashes,
    lots and lots of curvy eyelashes.
    I really don't know how she can see anything
    with so many freaking eyelashes.

    <br></br>
    So I decided to help her out.
    You know, we should help our fellow living-beings,
    and all that.

    <br></br>
    <i>"Can you do anything?"</i>
    I asked her.

    <br></br>
    <i>"Sure. Lots of things,"</i>
    she replied.
    <i>"Why do you ask?"</i>

    <br></br>
    <i>"I think I might be able to help you."</i>

    <br></br>
    <i>"I don't need no help."</i>

    <br></br>
    <i>"Sure you do. All spiders need help."</i>

    <br></br>
    Anyway, long story short,
    I hired Clarisse as my personal secretary,
    and from now on she's going to help me out with all the
    intricacies of the English language.

    <br></br>
    As I already said in 
    <a href="/blog/2022/05/art-marketing-101-how-i-learned-to-stop-worrying-and-love-the-algorithm.html">[Part I]</a>
    of this series,
    the road to fame, glory, and artistic achievement
    is not really a road,
    but more like a labyrinth.
    So, imagine yourself as a rat.
    One of those cute, fluffy rats
    that scientist love to poke and cut into little pieces
    and---no, wait...
    That's not really the metaphor I was looking for...

    <br></br>
    Clarisse tells me I'm rambling.
    Alright.
    I guess I should jump straight to what matters,
    and continue with my bullet-point advices.
    (also, don't forget to always start these practices
    by 
    <a href="/blog/2022/02/seo-conjuration-for-the-pro-active-artist.html">conjuring the right entities</a>.)

    <h2>You Should Enter Art Competitions</h2>

    As all artists know very well,
    the upper floors of the towers are
    fiercely protected by all sorts
    of gatekeeping agents of the nastier sort.

    <br></br>
    Once in a while, one of our comrades
    is lucky enough to squeeze in through
    one of the tunnels of poison ivy,
    but even then the feast usually lasts for only a short while.

    <br></br>
    How many of us have gotten up there
    only to be thrown down an elevator shaft
    after only a couple of days or even hours?

    <br></br>
    Thus is the art business.

    <br></br>
    Anyway, as for art competitions,
    the rules are usually pretty simple:
    find a fellow artist residing in the same floor as
    you and follow them around until they happen to pass by an
    open elevator shaft.
    Then simply help them take the plunge.

    <br></br>
    Rinse and repeat until you're the only artist on the entire
    floor.

    <br></br>
    To be frank, this process can take years or even decades,
    as it is very difficult to find an open elevator shaft.

    <br></br>
    Also, artists (myself included)
    seem to very distrustful of elevators,
    for some reason.

    <br></br>

    <h2>In Person Art Promotion. Do Your Own Art Shows.</h2>

    I'm going to tell you a little story about my last art show.
    It was off-city, far deep in forest territory.
    I had to take two trains, one motor-boat, and two canoes
    just to get there,
    as no helicopter pilot wanted to transport me
    for the money I had available at the time.

    <br></br>
    The small town was built on top of a swamp,
    with a pier of rotting wood extending out to the
    greenish waters.
    Everything had a disgustingly sugary smell,
    like orchids mixed with absinthe and decaying bodies.

    <br></br>
    The town's people all lived up in tree-houses,
    away from crocodiles, carnivorous plants,
    and the kind of giant butterflies that just love to grab
    tiny pink humans from their cribs.
    You have to be ready to fight for your life at all times,
    if you want to live I such place.

    <br></br>
    Seen up-close, the houses look like
    flickering images, as seen in those ancient TVs
    with oval-shaped screens
    and large rotating knobs.
    The town-folks, on the other hand,
    look absolutely normal,
    but sound like out of tune radio stations,
    complete with advertising
    in between every other sentence and all.

    <br></br>
    Clarisse tells me my poor understanding of the language
    is starting to show a little too much,
    and that no one will understand what the hell I am talking
    about.

    <br></br>
    It doesn't matter.
    I'm describing things exactly as I remember them,
    and that's all I really care.

    <br></br>
    The gallery only had three of my images, by the way,
    and two of those looked like they had been dropped in the
    acid swamp waters.
    I was so pleased with the result that I tried to do the same
    to the third image.
    Unfortunately, the gallery owners
    didn't like my idea
    and I was forced to spend the night
    in a shoddy cage
    suspended above the water,
    exposed to the nighttime hallucinogenic vapors...

    <br></br>
    So I woke up back in my apartment in the towers,
    and the nice lady from the Communal Care Association
    told me that I had been very lucky indeed.

    <br></br>
    <i>"Please promise me you'll never try to expose your,
        hmmm, art again,"</i>
    she said.

    <br></br>
    I didn't promise a thing, of course.

    <br></br>
    Three months later, I got a message from my bank
    saying a very strange thing indeed:
    there was money in my account!

    <br></br>
    Apparently, the gallery had sold one of my images.
    The other two, they said, turned to dust
    due to the acid.

    <br></br>
    With the money,
    I was able to buy
    a vegetable sandwich
    and a small bottle of synthetic red wine.

    <br></br>
    What a day that was!

    <br></br>
    Oh boy, I'm running out of blog-space again.
    I guess I'm not going to write all my remaining
    SEO advices in this part after all...

    <br></br>
    Also, Clarisse tells me I'm running low on keywords,
    that the Mighty Algorithm is never going to find me,
    that maybe I should follow my own SEO recommendations,
    and that she's bringing her husband and kids to live with
    us, so I better stock up the fridge
    'cuz there's going to be a lot of mouths to feed...
