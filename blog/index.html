    I guess that by now you must be asking yourself
    if this thing will ever come to a proper ending.
    And you are absolutely right.
    This collection of advices on how to please our algorithmic
    overlords and achieve
    artistic sublimation
    and financial plenitude
    and sexual satisfaction
    and grammatical correctness
    and social acceptance
    and a suitable fashion sense
    and all those other things you have been dreaming about,
    indeed, all those things you have been demanding from your
    website and social media accounts
    even at the risk of alienating
    your friends and family,
    while writing keyword laden
    blogs posts about nothing whatsoever
    that frequently spiral out of control
    in ever more unhinged,
    weirdly (un)personal
    (dis)pleasing nonsense that—where was I going
    with all this?
    Ah, yes,
    something about art marketing and SEO.

    Last night I had a dream.
    I really shouldn't bother you with it,
    but I guess I'm going to anyway.
    You see--the thing is--how should I start...
    Well, when I woke up today,
    first thing I saw was this cute little spider
    perching right on top of my nose.
    And the dammed thing winked at me!
    Actually, it was not that little.
    Or cute.
    More like a black grape with hairy legs,
    and long eyelashes,
    lots and lots of curvy eyelashes.
    I really don't know how she can see anything
    with so many freaking eyelashes.

  Influenced by Hans Kritopoterous's
  Artistry of the Sub-Lunar Mental States,
  Jean Burrous was the most vocal proponent
  of the idea of Surveillance Art,
  which states that the person under surveillance
  is the work of art.
  Being the proverbial
  starving-artist,
  isolated, malnourished, and paranoid,
  Jean spent years closed off in a tiny room down in the lower
  floors of one of the older towers.
  There, he read, according to him, thousands of books about
  digital art, computers, algorithms,
  privacy-enhanced surveillance systems,
  dreamscape advertisement-delivery short-waves,
  and, naturally, the old books on abstract expression,
  action painting, color-field theory, etc.

  The last time I went to an art exhibition was maybe a year ago
  when my friend Bill was courteously invited by the Metro
  Tower Art Complex's administration
  to showcase a few of his most popular sound-and-vision
  happenings.
  So, I had to go all the way over
  to the top floors of one of the central towers, down by the
  seashore.
  It took me almost half a day just to get there,
  and then it turned out that the entrance was down on the ground
  level.

  My new computer
  is growing up nicely.
  It now occupies an entire room in my apartment,
  and is fully integrated with the water plumbing.
  It even has a little system to collect rain water from the
  veranda
  which it then transmogrifies into these little drops of
  greenish liquid that emits the strangest, dreamiest sounds
  imaginable.

  Starting at the young age of two,
  when my parents gave me a hook and fishing line,
  I spent most of my time down by the river,
  watching as nature reclaimed all that man as spent millennia building.

  One summer morning I caught a big old tree
  with a bait my grandad had taught me:
  a small mirror hidden inside a silk-line fastened acorn.
  The mirror was painted red. Blood-red.
  That's how I started to paint, actually,
  by dabbing paint all over my reflected image.

  Well, Frank settled down in the city, his wild years long gone and
  forgotten, and every day, with a limp and a cigarette, he walks down from
  his two-room apartment to the library downtown where he spends the days
  reading and sleeping and forgetting about the images in his
  head.
  And every day he floats through the tall windows and opens his wings of
  golden shimmer against the rain-drenched smog while glass facades melt
  under red lights.

  People will often approach me
  with a shy smile and downcast gaze,
  and question me about my artistic career.
  "How is it," they ask, "that you can be so successful,
  so brilliant, so famous and beloved,
  while we, the rest of humanity,
  remain in this uneducated darkness.
  How can we ever hope to achieve,
  or to even barely touch your greatness?"
  This sort of thing amuses me, obviously.

  Please repeat after me:
  om mani padme hum.

  om mani padme hum
  Now keep saying these six syllables

  My troubles began when I started hanging out with a spider...
  I know, I know! you don't really need to lecture me about the
  dangers of socializing too often with arachnidas,
  arthopods, or any other exoskeleton-covered animals.
  Anyway, there I was, 
  busy messing about with the 
  Colores Aglaia
  thing,
  cursing at myself for never being able to get the damned
  image right the way I wanted it,
  my trusty 
  new computer
  huffing and puffing in a cloud of scarlet-tinted vapor
  (boy, do these new generation machines have an awful breath!),
  when it suddenly hit me:
  the colors were all wrong!
  I mean, you know that feeling, right?
  when all the colors suddenly start reeking
  like the corpse of an ancient forest
  and you feel like you're sitting on a chair made of
  pine-cones?
