      <description> My new computer is growing up very nicely.  It now occupies an entire room in my apartment, and is fully integrated with the water plumbing, even having a little system to collect rain water from the veranda which it then transmogrifies into these little drops of greenish liquid that emits the strangest, dreamiest sounds imaginable.</description>

      <description>so, I woke up today and immediately fell out the window and SPLAT! right on the sidewalk, people crawling all over me, complaining about the bleeding man lying all twisted on their path to very important things. anyway, when the ambulance finally arrived, they had to scrape me off the pavement. I&amp;rsquo;m telling you, it&amp;rsquo;s been a stressful day, but long story short, when I finally got home I turned on my trusty new computer and spent a few hours attacking this poor image.</description>

      <description>that one summer afternoon the sun was so bright, so warm, so overwhelmingly penetrating, that I had to rush my pet octopus back inside lest the poor thing would start flying off (it wouldn&amp;rsquo;t be the first time!).
anyway, back inside, I sat down with my old computer and stared at the screen till it went cherchons la flamme! fammfamm! fammfamm!
then this image appeared. did I do a good job?</description>

      <description>well, Frank settled down in the city, his wild years long gone and forgotten, and every day, with a limp and a cigarette, he walks down from his two-room apartment to the library downtown where he spends the days reading and sleeping and forgetting about the images in his head.
and every day he floats through the tall windows and opens his wings of golden shimmer against the rain-drenched smog while glass facades melt under red lights.</description>

      <description>people will often approach me with a shy smile and downcast gaze, and question me about my artistic career. &amp;ldquo;how is it,&amp;rdquo; they ask, &amp;ldquo;that you can be so successful, so brilliant, so famous and beloved, while we, the rest of humanity, remain in this uneducated darkness. how can we ever hope to achieve, or to even barely touch your greatness?&amp;rdquo;
this sort of thing amuses me, obviously.
but they insist: &amp;ldquo;and your writing prowess!</description>

      <description>yes.
please repeat after me:
om mani padme hum.
again:
om mani padme hum.
now keep saying these six syllables
in your mind,
over and over till nothing else
exists in there.
till your thinking processes
become purified, clear,
perfectly in sync with the universe.
say this mantra to yourself
over and over and over
and it will become your ego,
your flesh,
your substance.
it will become you,
it will move like you,</description>

      <description>&amp;hellip;and dirty art, flawed art, art made by weirdos and misfits, those who vibrate from anxiety and pain and from feeling too much. art made on a whim, on a rush, without thinking. art made by those who can&amp;rsquo;t possibly make what they want to make. art by the ugly, the defective, the unlearned, the starving, by those without skin, their nervous endings exposed and freezing in the wind, their gums receding to the bone.</description>

anyway, there I was, busy messing about with the Colores Aglaia thing, cursing at myself for never being able to get the damned image right the way I wanted it, my trusty new computer huffing and puffing in a cloud of scarlet-tinted vapor (boy, do these new generation machines have an awful breath!</description>

      <description>&amp;ldquo;Keep quiet, please.&amp;rdquo;
The medic stares at my sore scalp through cracked lenses. There are frail tweezers and alcohol, rusty syringes aligned between two poetry books, intermittently blinking monitors looking like long-abandoned miniature aquariums, vials of expired drugs in half-rotten cardboard boxes, a row of crimson-glazed ants marching past the abandoned decanters like a conquering army&amp;mdash;
&amp;ldquo;I don&amp;rsquo;t think you&amp;rsquo;ve been honest with me&amp;hellip;&amp;rdquo;
On the veranda, a chrysanthemum flower blooms like a flesh wound, its petals stretching across the windows.</description>
